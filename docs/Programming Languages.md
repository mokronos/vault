Need the right tool for the job.

## Python

Python can be nice in data analysis or quick experiments, but for larger projects it seems to be way to forgiving in terms of error handling and type safety, which can lead to bugs.

## C

Probably the first thing one should learn as it's the base for many other languages.

## Rust

Based. But difficult in the beginning.

## JavaScript

Important for some web stuff, but a lot can be done with just htmx (which is js). But why on the server? I heard that jsdocs seems nicer than typescript, because it achieves the same thing without a compilation step.
